# PauseWhenEmpty
Minecraft datapack that 'pauses' the worlds when no players are online. This useful for keeping the local difficulty the same when no players are online.

## Download
The datapack files can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Electrenator/PauseWhenEmpty/releases)

## Installing
Extract the zip when downloaded. Then put the PauseWhenEmpty folder into the `datapacks` folder of your world save. This will activate PauseWhenEmpty automatically on the next server startup.  
In the case your server is already running, just run the `/minecraft:reload` command and it should start. (Note: on a unmodified Minecraft server the command for this is `/reload`)

## Removing
For a clean removal use the `/function pwe:remove` command first. After that you can remove the datapack files out of your `datapacks` folder.
